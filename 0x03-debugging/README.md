# Learning Objectives
- By the end of this assignment, as a student, I should be able to:
- Explain what debugging means.
* Identify and fix common coding errors manually.
* Read and interpret compiler error messages.
* Apply logical debugging using test files.

## General Requirements
* Use vi, vim, or emacs only.
* Each file must end with a new line.
* Each directory must include a README.md file.
* All files must compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with GCC.

## Project structure: 
All files are the directory called 0x03-debugging

The main header require for this project is main.h.
This contains all the prototypes for functions of this projects

## **-Task Overview-** 


## TASK 0:		
### Objective:
Test the function positive_or_negative() with 0.
### Instructions:
Create a file 0-main.c that tests the function positive_or_negative() using 0 as input.

*Files to submit:
- 0-main.c and main.h

## TASK 1:
### Objective:
Stop an infinite loop by commenting out the problematic line.
+ Instructions:
Copy this code and comment out the section causing the infinite loop (do not delete).
File: 1-main.c

## TASK 3:			Leap Year
### Objective:
Fix print_remaining_days() to handle leap years correctly.

Files:
