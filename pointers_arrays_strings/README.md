# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Project Overview
This project is part of the *WinMingle Software Engineering Training* program.
It focuses on understanding and applying pointers, arrays, and strings in C
programming while following strict coding standards and best practices.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I am able to explain:
- What pointers are and how to use them
- What arrays are and how to use them
- The differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use and manipulate strings
- Scope of variables in C

## Project Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Compilation environment: **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- Compiler: `gcc`
- Compilation flags:

- All files end with a new line
- Code follows **Betty style guidelines**
- No global variables
- Maximum of **5 functions per file**
- No standard library functions (`printf`, `puts`, etc.)
- `_putchar` is allowed
- Header file must be named `main.h` and contain all prototypes

## Repository Information
- **Repository:** `winmingle-low_level_programming`
- **Directory:** `pointers_arrays_strings`

## Files Description

| File Name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `main.h` | Header file containing function prototypes |
| `0-reset_to_98.c` | Updates the value pointed to by an integer pointer to 98 |
| `1-swap.c` | Swaps the values of two integers |
| `2-strlen.c` | Returns the length of a string |
| `3-puts.c` | Prints a string followed by a new line |
| `4-print_rev.c` | Prints a string in reverse |
| `5-rev_string.c` | Reverses a string |
| `6-puts2.c` | Prints every other character of a string |
| `7-puts_half.c` | Prints half of a string |
| `8-print_array.c` | Prints `n` elements of an integer array |
| `9-strcpy.c` | Copies a string from source to destination |
| `100-atoi.c` | Converts a string to an integer |
| `101-keygen.c` | Generates random valid passwords for a crackme program |

## Compilation
Each file can be compiled using:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
